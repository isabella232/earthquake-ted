Tweet Earthquake Detector (TED) source code repository


This repository contains a combination of development and production software.

The 'prototype' directory contains several applications in various stages of development and exists to maintain a historical timeline of general TED software development efforts.

The 'PDL2Twitter' directory contains a production-grade application used to send Earthquake Notification tweets to Twitter.  It supports up to four (4) Twitter accounts, each with its own magnitude threshold for triggering.
