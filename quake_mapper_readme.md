Introduction
------------

Quake_mapper maps TED detections and PDL earthquake events using the Python module Cartopy. Its methods still need to be integrated into event_trigger, eventmatch_trigger, and detection_catcher so that maps can be automatically created. It also needs to be tested more to ensure that high-quality maps are produced for all detections and events.

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

Quake_mapper has been designed to run in Python 3.
